## üîß Prerequisites

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **Package Manager**: npm (comes with Node.js) or pnpm (recommended)
- **Git**: For cloning the repository ([Download](https://git-scm.com/))
- **Code Editor**: VS Code recommended ([Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

To verify your installations, run:

```bash
node --version    # Should show v18.0.0 or higher
npm --version     # Should show 8.0.0 or higher
git --version     # Should show 2.0.0 or higher
```

---

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to set up the project on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ruwanima/ella-south-star-frontend.git
cd ella-south-star-frontend
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

The project uses several modern React 19 and Next.js 15 packages. Use the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to ensure compatibility:

**Using npm:**
```bash
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
```

**Using pnpm (recommended):**
```bash
pnpm install
```

This will install all required dependencies including:
- Next.js 15 framework
- React 19 and React DOM
- Radix UI component library
- Tailwind CSS 4
- TypeScript
- And other supporting libraries

### 3. Verify Installation

After installation completes successfully, verify that the `node_modules` folder has been created and contains all dependencies:

```bash
# List the contents (optional)
ls node_modules  # On Unix/Mac/Linux
dir node_modules  # On Windows
```

---

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running the Application

### Development Mode

Start the development server with hot-reload enabled:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Or with pnpm:
```bash
pnpm dev
```

The application will start on `http://localhost:3000`. You should see output similar to:

```
  ‚ñ≤ Next.js 15.5.6
  - Local:        http://localhost:3000
  - Ready in 2.5s
```

### Production Build

To create an optimized production build:

```bash
# Build the application
npm run build

# Start the production server
npm run start
```

### Linting

To check code quality and formatting:

```bash
npm run lint
```

### Route Group Explanation

The project uses Next.js 13+ route groups (folders with parentheses) to organize routes without affecting the URL structure:

- `(admin)/` - All admin routes accessible via `/dashboard`, `/user-management`, etc.
- `(user-portal)/` - All user routes accessible via `/accommodations`, `/booking`, etc.

This keeps the codebase organized while maintaining clean URLs.
